## Pizza Homework 

Objectives

I created a front-end pizza configurator for a Codaisseur homework.


It is a single page that contains all the following elements. 

First you pick your base. You have four options:

1. 25cm NY Style € 8,99
2. 30cm NY Style € 11,49
3. 35cm NY Style € 13,49
4. 20cm NY Style € 6,45

After that you pick your sauce options:

1. White sauce
2. Red sauce
3. Double red sauce € 1,00
4. Mix it up € 1,50 

After that you pick one or more toppings:

1. Pineapple
2. Corn
3. Olives (green)
4. Red unioun
5. Spinach
6. Cherry tomatoes
7. Chicken

_Rules: max. 3 toppings, toppings cost € 0,50 apiece_

Last but not least, you can choose turbo-drone-delivery which is an additional 10% on top of the total pizza price. 

You can change previous steps even if you already changed stuff before. So you could pick a base, a sauce and a topping and switch the base after that. 

Additional instructions:

1. If any base is picked there should always be a price shown for the total pizza. 
2. The redux store should contain the state of the pizza
3. No backend connection
4. Multiple react controlled form components are used
